An appointments management app that demonstrates:

- Getting available slots for doctors
- Booking appointments
- Managing appointment status
- Updating appointment times
- Retrieving appointment details

## Create Next.js App

```bash
npx create-next-app@14.1.0 appointments-app
cd appointments-app
```

## Install Eka Care SDK

```bash
npm install @eka-care/eka-care-core
```

## Setting Up Backend Auth

Head to this [repo](https://github.com/eka-care/ekathon-nextjs-auth-template-api) and you will have a deployed live running backend in 1 click.

## Building the Appointments App

Replace `pages/index.js` with:

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import createEkaInstance from "@eka-care/eka-care-core";

export default function AppointmentsApp() {
  const [ekaInstance, setEkaInstance] = useState(null);
  const [slots, setSlots] = useState(null);
  const [appointment, setAppointment] = useState(null);
  const [appointmentDetails, setAppointmentDetails] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    initializeSDK();
  }, []);

  const initializeSDK = async () => {
    const authRes = await fetch(
      "https://your-backend.vercel.app/api/manage-auth",
      {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      }
    );

    const authData = await authRes.json();

    const ekaInstanceResult = createEkaInstance({
      source: "FE",
      auth_token: authData.data.access_token,
      backendAuthEndpointURL: "https://your-backend.vercel.app/api/manage-auth",
    });

    setEkaInstance(ekaInstanceResult);
  };

  // Get available slots for a doctor
  const getAvailableSlots = async () => {
    const availableSlots = await ekaInstance.appointments.getSlotsForDoctor({
      doctor_id: "doc123",
      clinic_id: "clinic456",
      start_date: "2025-06-01",
      end_date: "2025-06-01",
    });
    setSlots(availableSlots);
  };

  // Book an appointment
  const bookAppointment = async () => {
    const newAppointment =
      await ekaInstance.appointments.bookAppointmentSlotForDoctor({
        isBusinessOrDoctorAssosiatedWithEka: true,
        clinic_id: "clinic456",
        doctor_id: "doc123",
        patient_id: "patient789",
        appointment_details: {
          start_time: 1748607760,
          mode: "INCLINIC",
        },
        patient_details: {
          dob: "2004-08-01",
          first_name: "John",
          gender: "M",
        },
      });
    setAppointment(newAppointment);
  };

  // Get appointments by date
  const getAppointmentsByDate = async () => {
    const appointments =
      await ekaInstance.appointments.getAllAppointmentsByDate("25-01-06");
  };

  // Get appointment details by ID
  const getAppointmentDetails = async () => {
    const details = await ekaInstance.appointments.getAppointmentDetailsById({
      appointment_id: "apt123",
    });
    setAppointmentDetails(details);
  };

  // Update appointment time
  const updateAppointmentTime = async () => {
    const updatedTime = await ekaInstance.appointments.updateAppointmentTime({
      appointment_id: appointment.appointment_id,
      start_time: Date.now(),
    });
  };

  // Manage appointment status
  const parkAppointment = async () => {
    await ekaInstance.appointments.parkAppointment({
      appointment_id: "apt123",
    });
  };

  const completeAppointment = async () => {
    await ekaInstance.appointments.completeAppointment({
      appointment_id: "apt123",
    });
  };

  const cancelAppointment = async () => {
    await ekaInstance.appointments.cancelAppointment({
      appointment_id: "apt123",
    });
  };

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto p-8">
      <div>...</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key SDK Methods Used

1. **Get Slots** - Retrieve available appointment slots for doctors
2. **Book Appointment** - Create new appointments with patient details
3. **Get Appointments** - Fetch appointments by date or ID
4. **Update Time** - Modify appointment start and end times
5. **Status Management** - Park, complete, or cancel appointments

## What We Built

A complete appointments management application using the Eka Care SDK where complex scheduling logic is handled by simple SDK method calls.
