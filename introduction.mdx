### How to Get Started with EKA Connect

#### **1. Onboarding**

**Pre-requisites**

- **Client ID**: A unique identifier assigned to a third-party application interacting with Eka's API.
- **Client Secret**: It is a confidential key, similar to a password used alongside the Client ID.

**Obtain the Client ID and Client Secret**

- Login to your Eka Care Control Panel at [Console](https://console.eka.care) and create client_id and client_secret
- If you are a developer and are looking to create an app for our doctors and patients you can either follow the end to end OIDC guidelines to connect Eka Accounts with yours, Or you can ask for API Key from your respective healthcare providers workspace to get access using API Key.

#### **2. Authentication**

EKA Connect’s API authentication process ensures secure access to sensitive healthcare data by using a strong and reliable system. Authentication helps confirm that the person or application making the request is who they claim to be. This ensures that the right user or system is interacting with the API.

**How to Authenticate with EKA’s API**

**1.** **Get an Access Token**

To start, you need to authenticate your client (your app) using the login API. When you log in with your Client ID and Client Secret, you’ll receive two tokens:

- **Access Token**: A short-lived token that you include in every API request to prove that your app is authorized. This token typically expires after 30 minutes, meaning you'll need to use refresh token api to create new one.([Access Token API](https://developer.eka.care/api-reference/authorization/client-login))
- **Refresh Token**: A longer-lived token that helps you get a new Access Token when the old one expires, without having to log in again. ([Refresh Token API](https://developer.eka.care/api-reference/authorization/refresh-token))

**2**. **Use the Access Token**

Once you have your Access Token, include it in the authentication header of all your API requests. This tells EKA that your app is authorized to access the data and services.

**3. Handle Token Expiration**

Access Tokens don’t last forever, they will eventually expire for security reasons. When this happens, you’ll get a 401 Unauthorized error. When that happens use  Refresh Token to call the refresh API and get a new Access Token.

### **What Comes After Authentication?**

Once you’ve authenticated and successfully integrated with EKA Connect, you can access various services and features designed to support healthcare integration. Here’s what’s available:

#### **1. ABDM Connect**([Reference](abdm-connect))
Introducing the **ABDM Connector**: A Comprehensive API Suite for Easy Integration.

The ABDM Connector is designed as a powerful, plug-and-play API suite that simplifies the integration of various healthcare solutions into the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) ecosystem. Whether you're looking to connect Electronic Health Records (EHR), hospital management systems, or other healthcare platforms, this connector facilitates seamless interoperability.

- **Full Support for All ABDM Functionalities**:
The connector offers a complete range of services required to connect to ABDM, including creating and linking Health IDs (ABHA), handling consent management, sharing health records, and much more.

- **Flexible Infrastructure Options**:
You can choose between using our shared cloud infrastructure—perfect for rapid deployment with minimal overhead—or setting up your own private cloud for greater control and security.

Whether you are a healthcare provider, technology partner, or hospital network, the ABDM Connector ensures a smooth, compliant, and efficient integration experience with the ABDM framework, empowering you to deliver better healthcare services at scale.


#### **2. Self Assessment**

Once you're authenticated, another important feature of EKA Connect is the Self Assessment tool. This feature allows healthcare providers, patients, and other stakeholders to assess their health status or other conditions digitally. Here’s what you can do:

- **Health Surveys**: Patients or users can answer personalized health assessments that help assess their current health status.
- **Symptom Checkers**: Users can input their symptoms, and the system provides a preliminary assessment or guidance based on the data.
- **Record Analysis**: Healthcare professionals can analyze the patient's health data collected through the self-assessment to make informed decisions.

#### **3. Doctor Tool Integration**

After successful authentication, the Doctor Tool Integration feature enables healthcare providers to manage patient interactions and medical workflows more efficiently.

- **Appointment Management**: Doctors can schedule, manage, and track patient appointments seamlessly through the platform.
- **Digital Prescriptions**: Easily generate and issue digital prescriptions, which can be accessed by patients and pharmacies.
- **Patient Records Access**: View patient profiles, health history, and medical records, including those linked through the ABDM.
