### Heart Health Monitoring Technology  

#### Overview  

Eka’s Heart Health Monitoring Technology empowers users with a reliable, mobile-based solution to estimate vital parameters, such as pulse rate, using only their smartphone. Developed in collaboration with Father Muller (FM) Medical College and Hospital, this innovative tool leverages the principles of Photoplethysmography (PPG) to provide accurate and accessible measurements.  

The technology is particularly suited to the Indian healthcare context, where easy access to reliable health monitoring can significantly enhance patient-doctor interactions. Validated on a diverse dataset comprising thousands of individuals across various physiological states and demographics, Eka’s solution delivers robust results, making it an essential tool for personal health monitoring.  

#### Use-Cases  

1. **Personal Health Monitoring**  
   Eka’s pulse rate monitor allows individuals to track their heart health conveniently through their smartphones, helping users maintain wellness and detect irregularities in real-time.  

2. **Remote Patient Monitoring**  
   This technology can assist healthcare providers in monitoring patients remotely, ensuring timely interventions for individuals with conditions like hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular diseases.  

3. **Integration with Telemedicine Platforms**  
   By enabling real-time vitals monitoring during teleconsultations, Eka’s solution enhances virtual healthcare experiences, allowing doctors to make informed decisions even in remote settings.  

4. **Public Health and Research Applications**  
   The technology facilitates large-scale health screening and data collection, contributing to research studies and public health initiatives that require insights into cardiovascular health trends.  

#### Technology Deep-Dive  

Eka’s Heart Health Monitoring Technology employs **Photoplethysmography (PPG)**, a technique that uses a smartphone camera in reflective mode to detect variations in light intensity caused by blood flow in the skin.  

- **Reflective Mode PPG:** The smartphone camera records changes in light reflected by blood vessels, allowing accurate pulse rate computation without additional hardware.  
- **Validation Dataset:** Our technology has been validated on over 5,700 patients across diverse demographics, physiological states, and clinical settings, ensuring reliability and robustness.  
- **Performance Across Conditions:** It works consistently across varying pulse rates (45-160 BPM), respiration rates, oxygen saturation levels (SpO2), and comorbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.  
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** The system accounts for unique conditions, such as patients wearing henna or nail paint, and demonstrates no significant drop in accuracy in these cases.  

#### Evaluation / Benchmarks  

To validate the accuracy of Eka's pulse rate monitor (EPRM), results were compared against Dr. Trust's pulse oximeter and Omron BP devices. Metrics include Interclass Correlation (ICC), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Error (ME):  

- **Interclass Correlation (ICC):** 0.95, indicating high consistency.  
- **MAE:** 3.47 BPM with a standard deviation of 2.65 BPM.  
- **ME:** 0.54 BPM, showing minimal bias.  

Additional findings:  
- MAE for women wearing henna or nail paint: 2.96 BPM, with no significant accuracy loss.  
- Results across comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension were consistent with overall findings.  

These benchmarks demonstrate that Eka’s solution operates within acceptable error margins for medical-grade devices.
