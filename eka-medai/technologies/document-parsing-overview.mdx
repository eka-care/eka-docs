title: Document Parsing
---

Eka Care’s AI-powered medical document parsing technology empowers partners to transform unstructured digital medical
 records—stored as PDFs or images—into structured, actionable medical data. The parsed data is meticulously cleaned, 
 consolidated, and enriched by linking medical concepts with globally recognized standards like SNOMED-CT and LOINC identifiers.
  By doing so, Eka Care enables partners to unlock the full potential of medical information that often remains underutilized 
  in diverse document formats.

Our technology can reliably parses critical information from these types of documents:  
- **Lab Investigation Reports**  
- **Digital Prescriptions**  
- **Health Insurance Policies**  

## Use Cases  

#### 1. Personal Health Record (PHR) Applications  
PHR applications empower consumers to manage their health more effectively by providing a consolidated, longitudinal view of their health metrics. As routine lab tests and medical consultations form a significant part of health journeys, Eka Care’s technology converts scattered medical records into structured data that builds a comprehensive health profile for users.  

#### 2. Insurance Providers  
Health insurance underwriting often involves extensive analysis of lab results and health reports, which are typically locked in PDFs or scanned images. Manual review of such records is costly and time-intensive. Eka Care’s advanced document parsing technology automates this process, improving efficiency and reducing costs by extracting key health data at scale.  

#### 3. Healthcare Providers  
A holistic, longitudinal view of a patient’s health enables better clinical decision-making. However, the fragmentation of medical records—stored as physical prints or unsearchable digital files—often hinders this capability. Eka Care’s parsing technology addresses these challenges, supporting digital tools that provide medical professionals with accessible, consolidated patient data. This not only enhances patient care but also enriches medical documentation practices.

## Technology Deep-Dive  

Our document parsing technology is powered by state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically trained on millions of anonymized medical documents. These documents span diverse formats and contexts, with a particular focus on the Indian healthcare ecosystem.  

Our rigorous supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process ensures exceptional accuracy while minimizing common pitfalls like hallucinations that affect other SOTA LLMs. The result is a highly reliable system, as demonstrated in the benchmarks provided in the subsequent section.  

Our process consists of two core steps:  
#### 1. **Information Extraction:** 
Extracting structured medical information from unstructured or pseudo-structured PDFs or images.
#### 2. **Information Linking:** 
Assigning identifiers from medical ontologies such as SNOMED-CT and LOINC, enabling the creation of comprehensive longitudinal health data.  

These steps ensure that our partners can seamlessly integrate parsed data into their systems, enriching decision-making and operational efficiency.
