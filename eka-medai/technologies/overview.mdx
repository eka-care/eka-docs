India's healthcare ecosystem generates one of the largest volumes of medical data globally. 
From prescriptions and lab reports to insurance claims and discharge summaries, the sheer scale of unstructured health data is staggering. 
Yet, this data remains vastly underutilized because of lack of standardization and interoperability. 
The lack of standardization, combined with regional nuances and varied document formats, makes automated processing a challenge. 
As a result, enterprises often resort to manual efforts to organize, process, and consume this information—delaying critical decision-making, 
bearing high costs, and limiting the potential for insights that could drive better healthcare outcomes.

EkaCare offers solutions to these challenges with a suite of cutting-edge AI-driven technologies tailored specifically to India’s diverse 
healthcare ecosystem.
