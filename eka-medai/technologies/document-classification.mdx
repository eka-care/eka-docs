## Technology Deep-Dive  

Our document classification service is powered by or custom Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically trained on millions of diverse medical documents. 
These documents span diverse formats and contexts, with a particular focus on the Indian healthcare ecosystem. 

Our rigorous training and fine-tuning process ensures exceptional accuracy while minimizing common pitfalls like hallucinations that often impact other SOTA LLMs. 
The result is a highly reliable system, as demonstrated in the benchmarks provided in the subsequent section.


## Evaluation and Benchmarks  

Our benchmark experiments with evaluation dataset comprising thousands of documents showcase Ekaâ€™s superior performance in terms of accuracy compared to other SOTA models. NOTE this evaluation dataset contains both PDF and clicked images.
