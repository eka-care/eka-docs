title: Medical Scribe
---

Eka Care brings cutting-edge GenAI capabilities to the medical speech processing. Our models not only provide better transcription accuracies (WER) but also  
enable seamless translation of of spoken medical information into structures. 

Designed specifically for the unique challenges of healthcare and linguistic nuances in India, this feature ensures accurate, context-aware
transcription for medical concepts. Eka's medical scribe is optimized for diverse accents, dialects, 
and terminologies prevalent in the Indian healthcare ecosystem, providing unparalleled accuracy and contextual relevance.

#### Use-Cases

1. **Electronic Medical Records (EMRs)**  
   Physicians through dictating or just recording their consultation with patients can readily created structured medical documents.  Eka’s scibe technology automates this process, ensuring accurate and contextually enriched EMRs.
   It supports medical professionals by saving time and improving patient documentation quality.

2. **Telemedicine Platforms**  
   Virtual consultations involve rich verbal interactions that often include complex medical terminologies. Our solution enables near real-time transcription of doctor-patient conversations, helping platforms provide 
   post-consultation summaries, auto-filled prescriptions, and structured clinical notes.

3. **Clinical Research**  
   Interviews and case studies form an essential part of clinical research. Our solution allows researchers to
    transcribe large volumes of spoken data efficiently, converting them into structured datasets that aid analysis and insights.

4. **Insurance Claim Processing**  
   Voice-recorded claims and customer support interactions often contain critical health-related information. By 
   transcribing and structuring these interactions, our services can simplify the claims process for insurers, improving
    turnaround times and customer satisfaction.


#### Technology Deep-Dive

Eka’s medical scribe is powered by custom audio LLMs optimized for medical contexts and Indian speech in different languages and accents, outperforming general-purpose ASR services.
 Our models are trained on a vast corpus of medical speech recordings, ensuring exceptional accuracy for domain-specificity.

Key technological features include:

- **Medical Vocabulary Integration:** Incorporates medical terms, drug names, and diagnostic terminology into the
 transcription process, ensuring precision.
- **Accent and Dialect Handling:** Designed to accurately transcribe diverse Indian accents and regional
 pronunciations common in healthcare interactions.
- **Noise and Interruptions Filtering:** Handles real-world audio scenarios like overlapping speech or background
 noise, producing clean and reliable transcriptions.

Our solution involves two major steps:

1. **Speech to text transcription / translation:** This step transcribes speech signal into text. 
2. **Entity extraction and linking:** In this step transcription is converted into a well structured medical data. Our structuring granularity goes beyong SOAP summaries providing entity level control.


#### Evaluation / Benchmarks

EkaCare's scribe solution consistently outperforms general-purpose systems and SOTA models as demonstrated by the benchmark table below.
