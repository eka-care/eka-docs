## Overview  

EkaCare's Lab Report Parsing solution leverages its customised [vision-LLM](https://info.eka.care/services/lab-ready-and-prescription-perfect-ekas-small-llms-vs-industry-giants) to accurately extract structured data  
such as test names, results, units, and reference ranges. Designed specifically for the Indian healthcare ecosystem our solution offers high level of accuracy and doesn't involve human in a loop. 

#### This service offers:
- Extraction of test name, result, unit, reference ranges, panel and specimen
- Linking of test name to [LOINC](https://loinc.org/) identifiers
- Linking of unit to [UCUM](https://ucum.org/) identifiers
- Interpretation of test results
- Output as [HL7 FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) document
- Ability to work with PDFs as well as scanned / clicked images of lab reports

> We currently handle LOINC linking for 1400+ lab investigations that cover the majority of commonly performed lab investigations in India.

## Use Cases  

### 1. **HealthCare providers**  
   - Better clinical decision making leveraging longitudinal view of the diagnostic results results
   - Enriched medical records enabled by seemless copy of lab outcomes to prescription

### 2. **Personal Health Record (PHR)**  
   - Comprehensive health view based on lab investigations done over years
   - Improved awareness and management of health biomarkers

### 3. **Health Insurance Companies**  
   - Streamlining the processing of lab reports submitted during insurance claims.  
   - Automate fraud detection by validating extracted diagnostic data.


## Technology Deep-Dive  

Our lab report parsing technology is powered by or custom Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically trained on millions of anonymized medical documents. 
These documents span diverse formats and contexts, with a particular focus on the Indian healthcare ecosystem.  

Our rigorous training and fine-tuning process ensures exceptional accuracy while minimizing common pitfalls like hallucinations that often impact other SOTA LLMs.  
The result is a highly reliable system, as demonstrated in the benchmarks provided in the subsequent section.

Our process consists of two core steps:  
#### 1. **Medical Information Extraction:** 
Extracting structured medical information from unstructured or pseudo-structured PDFs or images. This includes test names, results, units, ranges, panel names, specimen and method.

#### 2. **Medical Entity Linking:** 
Assigning identifiers to the extracted medical concepts. We use LOINC identifiers for lab tests and UCUM identifiers for units. 
This is what enables interoperability and interpretability of this rich diagnostic data.
