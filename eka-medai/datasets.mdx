## Why These Datasets Matter

### Bridging the Data Gap

Majority healthcare AI models developed today are trained on Western datasets, which may not accurately represent Indian patients' unique characteristics. These datasets address this critical gap.

### Enabling Homegrown Innovation

With access to high-quality Indian healthcare data, researchers and developers can build AI solutions tailored specifically to Indian healthcare challenges.

### Advancing Healthcare Equity

By democratizing access to these datasets, we aim to support broader participation in healthcare AI development across India.
