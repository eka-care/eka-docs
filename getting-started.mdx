## Step 1: Sign Up for an API Key
To get started, you need to sign up for an API key. This key will authenticate your requests and give you access to our API. Ping us and we will provide you with the required API Keys.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Environment
Before making API calls, ensure your environment is properly set up. We recommend using the following tools and libraries:

- **HTTP Client**: Use tools like Postman, cURL, or any HTTP client library in your preferred programming language.
