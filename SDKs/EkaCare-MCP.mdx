description: 'Access Curated Medical Knowledge-bases from Claude and OpenAI clients'

Eka Care's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server facilitates interaction with medical knowledge-bases specifically curated for the Indian healthcare context. While advanced models from Claude, OpenAI, and others can perform adequately in medical contexts, their responses often lack grounding in factual information and published references. Additionally, India faces a significant challenge with the absence of centralized repositories for branded medications in the public domain.

The Eka MCP Server addresses these challenges by providing structured access to curated knowledge-bases through specialized tools:

* **Indian Branded Drug Search**: Enables lookup across 500,000+ branded drugs available in India, returning comprehensive metadata including generic composition and manufacturer information to enhance LLM responses. Further details about this knowledge-base can be found [here](/eka-medai/indian_branded_drugs)
* **Indian Treatment Protocol Search**: Provides contextual access to over 180 treatment protocol documents published by authoritative Indian healthcare institutions such as ICMR and RSSDI. Furher details about this knowledge-base can be found [here](/eka-medai/indian_treatment_protocols)


Key Benefits:
* 🩺 Medical Accuracy: Grounds AI responses in verified healthcare information
* 🔄 Seamless Workflow: Provides critical information without requiring context switching
* 🛡️ Reduced Hallucinations: Relies on curated medical data rather than AI's implicit general knowledge
* 🌐 Open Ecosystem: Integrates with the growing MCP open standard
