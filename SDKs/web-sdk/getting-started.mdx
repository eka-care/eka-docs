title: "Eka Care TS SDK"
description: "TS sdk for Eka care APIs, has the following modules built in appointments, patients, medicationSearch and health assessment. with full TypeScript support and TS based autocomplete on `payload`, `fns`, return `responses`."
---

## Features

- **Complete TypeScript Support** - Full type safety with intelligent autocomplete
- **Healthcare Module Coverage** - Appointments, Patients, Medications, Health Assessments, ABHA (coming soon)
- **Easy Integration** - Simple setup for Node.js, Next.js, and React applications
- **Production Ready** - Robust error handling and validation
- **Auth** - you as a third party dev dont need to worry about auth or refresh token. since the SDK takes care of it. and everytime you call any of the SDK modules and fns it will automatically manage the auth token and its life-cycle and renewal

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install @eka-care/eka-care-core
```

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE BEFORE YOU START USING THE SDK

The SDK can be used on both BE and FE — just with different configs.

If you initialize the SDK in a backend JS/TS runtime like Node, Express, Next, etc., you can use a straightforward config. We’ve also made it FE-compatible with a slightly different setup.

---

### Setup for BE runtimes

You can initialize the SDK in your **backend** environment by simply passing the `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `api_key`.

> ⚠️ Make sure to store these credentials securely and never expose them on the frontend.

```ts
import createEkaInstance from "@eka-care/eka-care-core";

const myEka = createEkaInstance({
  client_id: "your_client_id",
  client_secret: "your_client_secret",
  api_key: "your_api_key",
});
```

---

### Setup for FE runtimes (React, Next.js, etc.)

To use the SDK in a client-side web app, you'll need to use a token-based flow and set up a small backend auth proxy. Here's how:

```ts
// NOTE: This API endpoint is already written — you can deploy it with one click,
// add your env variables, and have it running on your Vercel account. More on that below.

// Client side FE code ——>
const authRes = await fetch("https://your-backend.vercel.app/api/manage-auth", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
});

const authData = await authRes.json();

const ekaInstanceResult = createEkaInstance({
  source: "FE",
  auth_token: authData.data.access_token,
  backendAuthEndpointURL:
    "https://vercel-clone-from-eka-account-next.vercel.app/api/manage-auth", // make sure this is the full URL: https + your Vercel domain + the API route
});
```

And you're GTG! You can initialize it once (maybe in a `useEffect` with empty dependencies) and take it for a spin. The SDK is now fully FE-compatible.

---

### Get the backend up and running for FE auth

Only needed if you're using the SDK on the frontend.

We have starter templates you can deploy instantly:

- [Express Auth Template](https://github.com/eka-care/ekathon-express-auth-template-api)
- [Next.js Auth Template](https://github.com/eka-care/ekathon-nextjs-auth-template-api)

one click deployment button in the repo's readme
Use these to deploy the `/api/manage-auth` route mentioned above.
hence

- deploy the repo that you wish to use (express or Next)
- follow the deployment guidelines in the repo's readme
- have the backend up and running
  and you can now initialize the SDK on FE as well

- by first calling the backend api that you just deployed, and getting the auth token

```ts
const authRes = await fetch("https://your-backend.vercel.app/api/manage-auth", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
});

const authData = await authRes.json();
```

- and initing the SDK on client side

```ts
const ekaInstanceResult = createEkaInstance({
  source: "FE",
  auth_token: authData.data.access_token, // passing the auth token that you received from the above API call
  backendAuthEndpointURL:
    "https://vercel-clone-from-eka-account-next.vercel.app/api/manage-auth", // make sure this is the full URL: https + your Vercel domain + the API route
});
```

---

### Setup for BE runtimes

```typescript
import createEkaInstance from "@eka-care/eka-care-core";

const myEka = createEkaInstance({
  client_id: "your_client_id",
  client_secret: "your_client_secret",
  api_key: "your_api_key",
});
```

### Next.js API Route Example

```typescript
// pages/api/healthcare.ts
import createEkaInstance from "@eka-care/eka-care-core";

const myEka = createEkaInstance({
  client_id: process.env.EKA_CLIENT_ID,
  client_secret: process.env.EKA_CLIENT_SECRET,
  api_key: process.env.EKA_API_KEY,
});

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    const slots = await myEka.appointments.getSlotsForDoctor({
      doctor_id: "doc123",
      clinic_id: "clinic456",
      start_date: "2025-06-05",
      end_date: "2025-06-06",
    });

    res.status(200).json({ success: true, data: slots });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
}
```

});

// Handle different question types with full TypeScript support
const question = startResponse.questions[0];

if (question.component_code === "I-RADG") {
  // Radio group with qualifiers (Yes/No/Don't Know)
  const choices = question.component_data.choices; // ✅ Autocomplete works!

  const userResponse = [
    {
      selected_choices: [
        {
          choice_id: choices[0].choice_id,
          choice_label: choices[0].choice_label,
          choice_qualifier: "p", // "p" = Yes, "a" = No, "u" = Don't Know
        },
      ],
    },
  ];
} else if (question.component_code === "I-MULT") {
  // Multiple choice selection
  const choices = question.component_data.choices; // ✅ Autocomplete works!

  const userResponse = [
    {
      selected_choices: choices.slice(0, 2).map((choice) => ({
        choice_id: choice.choice_id,
        choice_label: choice.choice_label,
      })),
    },
  ];
} else if (question.component_code === "I-ATSG") {
  // Autosuggest symptoms
  const staticChoices = question.component_data.autosuggest_static_choices; // ✅ Autocomplete works!

  const availableChoices = staticChoices.sections[0]?.choices || [];
  const userResponse = [
    {
      selected_choices: availableChoices.slice(0, 2).map((choice) => ({
        choice_id: choice.choice_id!,
        choice_label: choice.choice_label || choice.common_name!,
      })),
    },
  ];
}

// Continue assessment
const continueResponse = await myEka.assessment.continueAssessment({
  assessment_id: assessment.assessment_id,
  client_id: "your_client_id",
  qid: question.qid,
  user_response: userResponse,
});

// Submit final assessment

  assessment_id: assessment.assessment_id,
  client_id: "your_client_id",
});

console.log("Health Assessment Results:", results.likelihood);
```

## TypeScript Autocomplete

The SDK provides full TypeScript support with intelligent autocomplete. Press `Ctrl+Space` to see available options, methods, args and responses:

![TypeScript Autocomplete](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-Autocomplete-blue)

```typescript
// Autocomplete works throughout the entire SDK
myEka. // Shows all available modules
myEka.assessment. // Shows all assessment methods
myEka.appointments. // Shows all appointment methods

// Type safety for parameters
await myEka.appointments.getSlotsForDoctor({
  // Autocomplete shows required fields
  doctor_id: "",
  clinic_id: "",
  start_date: "",
  end_date: "",
});
```

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file:

```bash
EKA_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
EKA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
EKA_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### TypeScript Configuration

Ensure your `tsconfig.json` includes:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  }
}
```

---

## Response Types

All methods return properly typed responses:

```typescript
// Assessment results are fully typed
interface LikelihoodItem {
  id: string;
  desc: string;
  text: string;
  likelihood: string;
  relevant_doctor_specialities: string[];
}

// Appointment data is structured
interface AppointmentDetails {
  appointment_id: string;
  status: string;
  start_time: number;
  // ... and more
}
```

---

## Error Handling

The SDK would never break the app and has try/catch at every important step. but for proper UX its recommended to wrap its usage with your own try/catch or .then and .catch

```typescript
try {
  const result = await myEka.appointments.getSlotsForDoctor({
    doctor_id: "doc ID",
    clinic_id: "clinic ID",
    start_date: "2025-06-06",
    end_date: "2025-06-06",
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error("API Error:", error.message);
  // Handle error appropriately
}
```
