**Steps to Use Medical Document Parsing APIs:**
1. [**Authorization](https://developer.eka.care/api-reference/authorization/client-login):** Use the Client Login API to generate an access token. Use this token for authorization in all API requests.
2. [**Upload Medical Records**](https://developer.eka.care/api-reference/general-tools/medical/lab-report/create-records-v2): Upload image or PDF files of medical record following the specified document specs. Upon successful upload, you will receive a `document_id`.
3. [**Retrieve Parsed Report**:](https://developer.eka.care/api-reference/general-tools/medical/lab-report/retrieve-health-records) Use the document_id to retrieve the parsed report. The response will be in [FHIR JSON format](https://developer.eka.care/api-reference/general-tools/medical/lab-report/retrieve-health-records). The same API can be used to check the parsing status.
4. [**Delete Medical Report**](https://developer.eka.care/api-reference/general-tools/medical/lab-report/delete-records): Instantly remove an uploaded document from our system using the Delete Report API by providing its unique `document_id`
