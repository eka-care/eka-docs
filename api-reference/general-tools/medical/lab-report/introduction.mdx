**Steps to Use Medical Document Parsing APIs:**
1. [**Authorization](/api-reference/authorization/client-login):** Use the Client Login API to generate an access token. Use this token for authorization in all API requests.
2. [**Upload Medical Records**](/api-reference/general-tools/medical/lab-report/upload-report): Upload image or PDF files of medical record following the specified document specs. Upon successful upload, you will receive a `document_id`.
3. **Parsed Report**: Two distinct formats are available to obtain parsed results. Use the document_id along with the required query parameter to fetch the results. The same API can be utilized to check the parsing status, and a webhook is also available for this purpose.
    3.a [**Retrieve Parsed Report**](/api-reference/general-tools/medical/lab-report/retrieve-parsed-records) The response is returned in a structured FHIR format.
    3.b [**Parsed Report Result API**](/api-reference/general-tools/medical/lab-report/parsed-report-result) This endpoint returns a JSON response that includes additional data such as normalized values, document page numbers, eka_ranges, and other pertinent details not captured in the FHIR object due to its limitations.
4. [**Delete Medical Report**](/api-reference/general-tools/medical/lab-report/delete-records): Instantly remove an uploaded document from our system using the Delete Report API by providing its unique `document_id`
