EkaScribe empowers doctors with voice-powered documentation. Simply dictate or let EkaScribe AI listen to consultations, and it will effortlessly generate structured medical documents.

## Prerequisites:
- **Register Webhook (One-time Setup) - optional**

        1. Before using the Ekascribe service, register a webhook to receive notifications when transcription is complete: - [API Reference for Webhooks](https://developer.eka.care/api-reference/connect/webhooks/register-webhook)

        2. When the transcription is complete, Eka Care will send a webhook notification to your registered endpoint. Here's a sample of what you'll receive:

            ```json
            {
            "event": "v2rx.completed",
            "data": {
                "transaction_id": "unique_transaction_id",
                "status": "completed",
                "session_id": "session_123456"
            },
            "timestamp": "2023-07-20T10:30:00Z"
            }
            ```
