## Prerequisites:
- **Register Webhook (One-time Setup) - optional**

        1. Before using the Ekascribe service, register a webhook to receive notifications when transcription is complete: - [API Reference for Webhooks](https://developer.eka.care/api-reference/connect/webhooks/register-webhook)

        2. When the transcription is complete, Eka Care will send a webhook notification to your registered endpoint. Here's a sample of what you'll receive:

            ```json
            {
            "event": "v2rx.completed",
            "data": {
                "transaction_id": "unique_transaction_id",
                "status": "completed",
                "session_id": "session_123456"
            },
            "timestamp": "2023-07-20T10:30:00Z"
            }
            ```


## Custom Templates

### What are Custom Templates?
Custom templates allow you to format transcription results according to your specific business requirements. Instead of receiving raw transcribed text, you can get structured, formatted output that matches your workflow needs - such as medical consultation notes or any other specialized format.

### How to Get a Custom Template

1. **Contact Support**: Reach out to the Eka Care developer support team at **support@eka.care** or contact us through our official channels.

2. **Provide Requirements**: Share your specific formatting requirements, including:
   - The type of audio content you're transcribing
   - Desired output structure and format
   - Any specific fields or sections you need
   - Sample input and expected output examples

3. **Template Development**: Our team will work with you to develop and test a custom template that meets your needs.

4. **Template Registration**: Once approved, your custom template will be registered in the system and assigned a unique template identifier.

5. **Integration**: Use your registered template identifier in API calls to receive formatted results according to your custom template.

### Benefits of Custom Templates
- **Structured Output**: Get consistently formatted results every time
- **Time Saving**: Eliminate manual formatting and post-processing
- **Business-Specific**: Tailored to your industry and use case requirements
- **Scalable**: Once registered, use across all your transcription requests
