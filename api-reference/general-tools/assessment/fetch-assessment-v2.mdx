# Fetch and Group Assessments

This API provides powerful filtering capabilities and groups the results based on a combination of identifiers, making it easy to retrieve all assessments related to a specific interaction or entity.

The grouping is based on a composite key of `practitioner_uuid`, `patient_uuid`, `unique_identifier`, and `transaction_id`.
