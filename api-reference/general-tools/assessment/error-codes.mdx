### Error Response Format
---
The Assessment APIs returns custom error messages for invalid requests in
addition to HTTPS codes.
The failed response contains some properties. These properties and their
values are more indicative of the underlying error.


### Error Response Syntax
---
``` json
{
    "error": {
        "error_code": "unique_error_code",
        "display_message": "Display message for the user",
        "message":  "Actual error message from the server"
    }
}
```

### Error Fields
---

Here is the description of the error fields present in the error body


| **Field** | **Description** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `error` | This field represent an error occurred while processing the request. It contains a list of errors. Developers can identify the request is not succeeded based on this field. | `{"error": { "error_code": "missing_field", "display_message": "gender field is required", "message": {"user_info": {"gender": ["This field may not be null." ] }}}]}` |
| `error_code` | This field represent a custom error code to distinguish between different kind of errors. These error codes are custom and are our platform specific. You can see more about `error_code` in next section. | `{"error_code": "missing_field"}` |
| `display_message` | Error display message for the user. | `"display_message": gender field is required` |
| `message` | The actual error message from the server. | `"message":{"user_info": {"gender": ["This field may not be null."]}}` |

### Error Codes
---
These are the custom error code field present in failure response body.
There can be various factor that can cause the request to fail. Sometimes
this kind of errors needs to be grouped according the the reason of failure.
This allows developers to diagnose the errors faster.
