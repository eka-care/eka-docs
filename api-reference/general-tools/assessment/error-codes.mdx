### Error Response Format
---
The Assessment APIs returns custom error messages for invalid requests in
addition to HTTPS codes.
The failed response contains some properties. These properties and their
values are more indicative of the underlying error.


### Error Response Syntax
---
``` json
{
    "error": {
        "error_code": "unique_error_code",
        "display_message": "Display message for the user",
        "message":  "Actual error message from the server"
    }
}
```

### Error Fields
---

The Error field represent an error occurred while processing the request. It contains a list of errors. Developers can identify the request is not succeeded based on this field.
Here is the the example of response in case of missing field in the request body.

``` json

        "error_code": "missing_field",
        "display_message": "Uh huh, you missed a required field",
        "message": "Missing required field - gender"
