Welcome to our comprehensive Assessment Platform, designed to provide users with tailored insights into their health. Our platform features three primary types of assessments:

## 1. Risk Assessments
Risk Assessments evaluate the likelihood of a user developing specific health conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension. By analyzing key factors, users receive a clear understanding of their risk levels.

## 2. Symptom Checker
Our Symptom Checker takes user-reported symptoms as input and, through a series of targeted questions, helps triage and identify probable diagnoses. This AI-driven tool is designed to streamline the assessment process and provide users with valuable insights.


> Each assessment in our platform is associated with a unique **Workflow ID**. This identifier is crucial for initializing and conducting assessments seamlessly. 
For more details on the Workflow IDs, please refer to the next topic [Assessment Workflows](./assessment-workflows) or contact support.
