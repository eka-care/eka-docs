Welcome to our comprehensive Assessment Platform, designed to provide users with tailored insights into their health. Our platform features three primary types of assessments:

## 1. Risk Assessments
Risk Assessments evaluate the likelihood of a user developing specific health conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension. By analyzing key factors, users receive a clear understanding of their risk levels.

## 2. Symptom Checker
Our Symptom Checker takes user-reported symptoms as input and, through a series of targeted questions, helps triage and identify probable diagnoses. This AI-driven tool is designed to streamline the assessment process and provide users with valuable insights.


## 3. Customized Assessments (Upcoming)
We are excited to introduce Customized Assessments, allowing users to create personalized workflows tailored to their unique needs. This feature is currently in development and will enhance the flexibility of our platform.  

Stay tuned for more details, and explore how our AI-led assessments can empower you on your health journey!  

> Each assessment in our platform is associated with a unique **Workflow ID**. This identifier is crucial for initializing and conducting assessments seamlessly. 
For more details on the Workflow IDs, please refer to the next topic [Assessment Workflows](./assessment-workflows) or contact support.
