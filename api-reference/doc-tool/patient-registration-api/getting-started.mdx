## Overview

The Patient Directory API is designed to manage patient information within a business' directory. This API allows for searching, adding, and editing patient details in a specific doctor's directory. It facilitates efficient patient management and ensures that all necessary information is up-to-date and easily accessible.

## Main Actors

- **Patient:** The individual whose information is being managed in the doctor's directory. This includes personal details, contact information, medical history, and other relevant data.

## Usage Notes

- Ensure that all required fields are provided when adding or editing patient information.
- Use appropriate search criteria to narrow down patient records effectively.
- Handle sensitive patient data with care and comply with relevant privacy regulations.
- Currently, a patient can only be added in reference to a doctor in a business. This automatically adds the patient to the business directory and allows searching at the business level.
