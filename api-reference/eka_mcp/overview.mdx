In the context of medical protocols, **"tags" or "conditions"** refer to categorization systems used to organize,
search, and identify specific protocols. These are essentially metadata elements that help healthcare professionals
quickly find the relevant protocols they need.

#### Medical Conditions
* These are the specific diseases, disorders, or clinical situations that a protocol addresses
* Examples: Diabetes, Stroke, Sepsis, Myocardial Infarction, Postoperative Care. <br />
To get all the tags/conditions, use [tags/conditions](/api-reference/eka_mcp/protocols/tags)

#### Protocol publishers
Publishers are organizations or entities responsible for developing, validating, distributing,
and maintaining medical protocols. They play a crucial role in ensuring healthcare professionals
have access to standardized, evidence-based guidance.
To get all the publishers for given tag/conditions, use [publishers_by_tag](/api-reference/eka_mcp/protocols/publishers_by_tag)

#### Medical protocols
Medical protocols are standardized sets of guidelines, procedures, and decision pathways that healthcare professionals
follow when diagnosing and treating specific conditions. They serve as comprehensive roadmaps for clinical care,
ensuring consistent and evidence-based treatment approaches across healthcare settings.
To get the list of all protocols for given condition and given publishers,
use [protocols](/api-reference/eka_mcp/protocols/protocols)

#### Medical Understanding
A pharmaceutical database system that searches and retrieves medication information through multiple parameters:

* Finds drugs by brand names
* Searches by generic/active ingredients
* Locates medications for specific diseases/conditions
* Identifies products by SKU or packaging options
* Filters by dosage forms (tablet, capsule, liquid)

Serves as a knowledge base for healthcare professionals and patients to find appropriate medications,
alternatives, and treatment options when needed. <br />
To search the drugs, use [search](/api-reference/eka_mcp/medications/interactions)

#### Medical Interactions
A system that checks if two drugs' active ingredients interact negatively with each other.
It identifies when medications shouldn't be prescribed together due to harmful interactions,
duplications, or conflicts that could reduce effectiveness or increase side effects.
To check if two brands interact with each other, use [interacts](/api-reference/eka_mcp/medications/understanding)
