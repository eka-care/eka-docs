## Why Use This API

Access generic information from India's National Formulary through a simple REST API. Instead of manually compiling medication databases or scraping multiple sources, get structured generic data that's already standardized and ready to use in your application.

This information has been extracted from guidelines published by the National Formulary of India from the Ministry of Health & Welfare (Government of India) - [Link](https://qps.nhsrcindia.org/sites/default/files/2022-01/National%20Formulary%20of%20India%20%28NFI%29%2C%202011.pdf)

The details have been extracted through a vision LLM and every generic has been validated by a team of clinicians at eka.care
