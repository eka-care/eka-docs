Link multiple medical terms to their corresponding SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) codes.

## Overview

This endpoint accepts an array of medical terms and returns their corresponding SNOMED CT identifiers along with confidence scores. SNOMED CT is a comprehensive clinical terminology that provides standardized codes for medical concepts.

## Usage

### Input Format
The `text_to_link` parameter accepts an array of medical terms or abbreviations:

```bash
curl --location --globoff 'https://api.eka.care/eka-mcp/linking/v1/snomed?text_to_link=["dm2", "htn"]'
```

### Common Medical Abbreviations
- **dm2** - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
- **htn** - Hypertension
- **copd** - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
- **mi** - Myocardial Infarction
- **chf** - Congestive Heart Failure

## Response Structure

Each linked term returns:
- **snomed_id**: The official SNOMED CT identifier
- **text**: The original text that was processed
- **confidence**: Confidence score of the mapping (0-1 scale)

## Benefits

- **Standardization**: Convert medical abbreviations and terms to standardized SNOMED codes
- **Interoperability**: Enable data exchange between healthcare systems
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Support automated clinical reasoning and decision-making
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple terms simultaneously for efficiency
