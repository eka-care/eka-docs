## Quick Start
### Authentication

```python
from ekacare import EkaCareClient

# Initialize with client credentials
client = EkaCareClient(
    client_id="your_client_id",
    client_secret="your_client_secret"
)

# Or initialize with an existing access token
client = EkaCareClient(
    client_id="your_client_id",
    client_secret="your_client_secret",
    access_token="your_access_token"
)

# Manually get an access token
token_response = client.auth.login()
access_token = token_response["access_token"]
```
---

## Error Handling

The SDK uses custom exceptions to handle errors:

```python
from ekacare import EkaCareClient, EkaCareAPIError, EkaCareAuthError

client = EkaCareClient(
    client_id="your_client_id",
    client_secret="your_client_secret"
)

try:
    documents = client.records.list_documents()
except EkaCareAuthError as e:
    print(f"Authentication error: {e}")
except EkaCareAPIError as e:
    print(f"API error: {e}")
```
