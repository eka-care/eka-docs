A Go SDK for integrating with Eka Care’s healthcare APIs, including ABDM (Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission) services.

## Overview

Use this SDK to authenticate with Eka Care, call ABDM services, and build backend integrations in Go with minimal boilerplate.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+ (matches the SDK’s go.mod)
- Eka Care developer account and credentials (client_id and client_secret)

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/eka-care/eka-sdk-go
```

Install a specific version (recommended for reproducible builds):

```bash
go get github.com/eka-care/eka-sdk-go@latest
# or pin to a specific release
go get github.com/eka-care/eka-sdk-go@vX.Y.Z
```

## Authentication and Setup

The SDK supports configuration via environment variables (recommended) or explicit options in code.

### Recommended: Environment variables

Set the following variables in your environment or a .env file:

```bash
# Required
export EKA_ENVIRONMENT=production   # or development
export EKA_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
export EKA_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

Then initialize the client from environment variables:

```go
client := ekasdk.NewFromEnv()
```

### Alternative: Explicit configuration (not recommended for production)

```go
client := ekasdk.New(
	ekasdk.WithEnvironment(ekasdk.EnvironmentProduction),
	ekasdk.WithClientID("your-client-id"),
	ekasdk.WithClientSecret("your-client-secret"),
)
```

## Quickstart

Authenticate and call an ABDM API (login init via PHR address):

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"

	ekasdk "github.com/eka-care/eka-sdk-go"
	"github.com/eka-care/eka-sdk-go/internal/interfaces"
	"github.com/eka-care/eka-sdk-go/services/abdm/abha/login"
)

func auth() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	// Create SDK client from environment variables
	client := ekasdk.NewFromEnv()

	// Authenticate with Eka platform
	if err := client.Login(ctx); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Authentication failed: %v", err)
	}
}
```

## Configuration reference

- EKA_CLIENT_ID: Client ID from the developer portal (required)
- EKA_CLIENT_SECRET: Client secret from the developer portal (required)
- EKA_ENVIRONMENT: production or development (required)

Configuration priority (highest to lowest):
- Environment variables
- Explicit options via WithXxx() functions
- Built-in defaults

## Troubleshooting

Typical auth/config errors when calling `client.Login(ctx)`:

```text
"client ID is required for authentication. Set EKA_CLIENT_ID environment variable or use WithClientID() option"
"client secret is required for authentication. Set EKA_CLIENT_SECRET environment variable or use WithClientSecret() option"
"failed to authenticate with provided credentials: invalid client credentials"
```
