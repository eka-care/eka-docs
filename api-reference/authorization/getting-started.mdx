## Overview

The Eka API Authentication process ensures secure access to sensitive healthcare data through a robust authentication process. To interact with the APIs, third-party developers must obtain an access token, use it in all API requests, and handle token expiration efficiently. This guide outlines the essential steps to securely integrate with Eka's API.

### Key Components

- **Client Application:** A third-party application that communicates with Eka's API.
- **Eka API Gateway:** The server-side component that authenticates and processes API requests.

<Steps>
<Step title="Obtain an Access Token">
    Authenticate your client using the [login](/api-reference/authorization/client-login) API. This will return both an access token and a refresh token, which you will use for subsequent API requests.
</Step>

<Step title="Using the Access Token">
    Include the access token in the `auth` header of every API request to authenticate and access Ekaâ€™s services
</Step>

<Step title="Handle Token Expiration">
    To ensure continuous access to the API, implement logic to manage token expiration and renewal.

    - If an API request returns a `401 Unauthorized` status code, it indicates that the access token has expired.
    - Use the [refresh token](/api-reference/authorization/refresh-token) API to obtain a new access token and re-authenticate.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

- Safeguard your client credentials (client_id and client_secret) at all times.
- Implement a reliable token renewal mechanism to handle token expiration.
- Always include the access token in the `auth` header for all API calls.
- Manage 401 Unauthorized errors gracefully by automatically refreshing the token.
- Ensure that your application complies with all privacy regulations when handling healthcare data.
