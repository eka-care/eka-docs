## Webhook Payload Examples

These are the samples of the webhook payloads that you will receive from Eka Care:

### Appointments

<Steps>

    <Step title="Appointment Webhook">
        When an appointment is created, modified, or completed, Eka Care will send a webhook event to your registered URL.

        **Example Payload:**
        ```json
        {
            "service": "dr",
            "event_type": "appointment.created",
            "event_time": 1730189586,
            "timestamp": 1730189588,
            "client_id": "{{client_id}}",
            "business_id": "{{business_id}}",
            "data": {
                "appointment_id": "12345-abcde-67890-fghij",
                "doctor_id": "0910731080189",

                }
            }
        }
        ```
