    <Step title="Request Presigned URL">
        To upload a file, the client must first obtain a presigned URL. This can be done by calling the **Obtain a Presigned URL for Document Upload** API.
        - **Limits:** The API can take a maximum of 10 records at a time.
        - **Note:** Ensure to adhere to any specified limits for the file sizes and formats.
        - **API Reference:** [Obtain Authorization](/api-reference/user-app/records/obtain-authorization)
    </Step>

    <Step title="Upload File">
        After receiving the presigned URL, use it to upload the document through the second API.
        - **Credentials:** Make sure to include the necessary credentials in your request to authenticate the upload process.
        - **API Reference:** [Upload Records](/api-reference/user-app/records/upload-records)
    </Step>

    <Step title="Update Documents">
        Once the file has been successfully uploaded, use the third API to link the uploaded record with ABHA.
        - **Linking:** This step is crucial for ensuring that the medical records are correctly associated with the patient's ABHA ID.
        - **API Reference:** [Link Record](/api-reference/user-app/records/link-record)
