    - An upload URL for each file
    - The required form fields necessary for secure upload
</Step>

<Step title="Step 2: Iterate Over Files">
    For each file entry in the batch, use the provided URL, the file to be uploaded, and the required form fields to construct a `multipart/form-data` request. The form fields, which are accessible in the `forms` array within the batch response.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 3: Upload to the Specified URL">
    Use the signed URL from the API response to upload the files. Ensure that the form fields are included in the request as part of the `multipart/form-data`. This upload is typically done via a `POST` request.
    <Note>
        When making the request, include the actual file to be uploaded along with the required form data. Upon successful upload, the server will respond with a **204 No Content** status code, indicating that the file was uploaded successfully.
