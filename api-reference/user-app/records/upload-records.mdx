## Uploading Records Using Signed URLs

Once authorized, follow this process to upload records:

### File Upload Process

After obtaining authorization from the [Upload Record](/api-reference/user-app/records/obtain-authorization) endpoint (HTTP 200), the API provides a batch of file entries requested by the client. Each entry includes:
- An upload URL for each file
- The required form fields for secure upload

For each file entry, construct a multipart/form-data request to upload the file. Use the provided URL, include the actual file, and add the necessary form fields accessible in the forms array of the batch response. Submit this request as a POST to the signed URL
<Note>
    A successful file upload will return a **204 No Content** response, confirming that the file was uploaded.
