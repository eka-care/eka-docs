A unique identifier assigned to each consent request.

**Consent Artefacts**

Consent artefacts are generated upon the approval of consents.
Multiple consent artefacts can exist for a single consent, each corresponding to different providers.
These artefacts represent the linkage between a healthcare provider (HIP) and care contexts.

Upon receiving a consent request, users can approve or deny the request.
Additionally, they can revoke consent given for older requests.

<Note> User Authorization will be required for all these operations.</Note>
