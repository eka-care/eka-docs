title: 'Care Context Discovery'

ABDM allows a user to find their health records from any health facility they have visited via the discovery process.

When a discovery request is initiated by the user, the HIP will receive a list of verified identifiers along with name and demographic information. Verified information includes the ABHA address, the mobile number name, gender, year of birth.
