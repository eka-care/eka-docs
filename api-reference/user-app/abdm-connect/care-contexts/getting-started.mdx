A Care Context represents a logical grouping of health records. Each HMIS, LMIS, or PHR system should determine how to organize data into one or more care contexts for a user. For example, a hospital system might create a care context for each hospital visit, a lab test is a care-context for LMIS, or user-uploaded records in a PHR app.

# Listing Care Contexts
<Note>
This feature is useful for displaying a list of care contexts to a doctor (HMIS) or within a PHR app.
</Note>
Listing linked Care Contexts involves two steps, as an ABHA address could have thousands of documents associated with multiple providers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="List Linked Providers">
    Use the [List Providers](/api-reference/user-app/abdm-connect/care-contexts/providers/providers) API to retrieve all linked providers. This API returns a `hip_id` and the name for each linked provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="List Care Contexts for a Provider">
    Using the `hip_id` obtained from the previous step, use the [List Care Contexts](/api-reference/user-app/abdm-connect/care-contexts/records/records) API to retrieve all linked care contexts for that provider.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Linking Care Contexts

## Creating a new Care Context

Care contexts can be linked to an ABHA in various ways, depending on the document type.

## HIP Inititated Linking

Use the [Link](/api-reference/user-app/abdm-connect/care-contexts/link/hip-linking) API to create the care context

## Upload a Medical Record

Use the [Upload](/api-reference/user-app/records/obtain-authorization) API to upload a document and API will automatically create a care context.

## Discover Unlinked Care Contexts

ABDM allows a user to find their health records from any health facility they have visited via the discovery process.
