        Use the [Initiate Aadhaar Registration](/api-reference/user-app/abdm-connect/enrollment/aadhaar/initiate-registration) endpoint to start the Aadhaar registration process.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify Aadhaar OTP">
        Use the [Verify Aadhaar OTP](/api-reference/user-app/abdm-connect/enrollment/aadhaar/verify-otp) endpoint to verify the OTP generated for Aadhaar registration.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify Mobile Number (Optional)">
        If the mobile number provided in the second step differs from the one linked to Aadhaar, use the [Verify New Mobile Number](/api-reference/user-app/abdm-connect/enrollment/aadhaar/mobile-verify) endpoint to verify the new mobile number.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create ABHA Address">
        Use the [Create ABHA Address](/api-reference/user-app/abdm-connect/enrollment/aadhaar/create-abha) endpoint to generate a new ABHA address.
