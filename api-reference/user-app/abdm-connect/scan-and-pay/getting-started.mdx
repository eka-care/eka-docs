This guide explains how developers can implement the **Scan & Pay** feature using the available APIs. The workflow enables a patient to scan a facility QR code, share their details, select an open order, view payment details, and complete the payment.

> **Note:** Each API response will include a unique `request_id` â€” you must supply that same `request_id` in your subsequent GET calls to retrieve the corresponding order or payment information.

### Scan & Pay API Workflow

<Steps>
    <Step title="Share Patient Details">
        Use the relevant API to share the patient's ABHA profile or identifier with the health facility after scanning the QR code. This step registers or identifies the patient in the facility's system.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select Open Order">
        Retrieve the list of open orders or pending bills for the patient using the facility's API. Allow the patient to select the order they wish to pay for.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Get Payment Details">
        Fetch the payment details for the selected order, including the total amount due and a breakdown of charges, using the appropriate API endpoint.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Make Payment">
        Initiate the payment process by calling the payment API with the order and patient details. Handle the payment response and display confirmation to the user upon success.
    </Step>
