The Profile API provides a set of endpoints for managing and accessing user profile information.
The API is designed to be allowing users to retrieve and update their profile details as well as access
associated assets like QR codes.

### ABHA Profile Management:

1. **Get the ABHA QR**

    The ABHA QR code provides a quick and efficient way to share and access ABHA profile details.
    Healthcare providers can scan the code to retrieve your ABHA ID and other vital information directly,
    streamlining processes like patient identification, medical history retrieval, and consent management.

2. **Fetching the ABHA Profile:**

    The API allows to retrieve comprehensive information from a user's ABHA profile.
    This includes personal details like name, date of birth, gender, and contact information, as well as other critical
    data linked to the ABHA ID.

3. **Deleting an ABHA Profile:**

    Deleting an ABHA profile is a significant and irreversible action. When a profile is deleted, all associated
    documents, vital records, and any related data are permanently removed from the system. This means the user will
    lose access to their ABHA ID and any linked medical history, with no option for recovery.

4. **Updating an ABHA Profile:**

    Updating an ABHA profile comes with certain conditions depending on how the profile was verified.
    - If the profile is Aadhaar-based, specific details such as the first_name, gender, and date_of_birth cannot be modified.
    These fields are locked to ensure the accuracy and integrity of KYC (Know Your Customer) information.
    - However, for profiles created or verified through mobile OTP, most of the profile details can be updated.

<Note> User Authorization will be required for all these operations.</Note>
