## User Session


Upon registration or creation of an ABHA, a user session is maintained with the ABHA Gateway.
This session expires after a certain period. When the session expires, APIs requiring ABHA Gateway authentication will return a `491` HTTP response code.


A ABHA Gateway Session creation requires a Mobile OTP (One-Time Password) Authentication.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Generate Mobile OTP">
        Use the [Initiate Session: Generate Mobile OTP](/api-reference/user-app/abdm-connect/session/init) endpoint to start a new session by generating a mobile OTP. This session is linked to the provided ABHA address, and a `txn_id` (Transaction ID) will be returned for tracking and verification.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify Mobile OTP">
        Use the [Verify Mobile OTP: Get User Session Token](/api-reference/user-app/abdm-connect/session/verify) endpoint to verify the OTP generated in the previous step. Provide the OTP and `txn_id` associated with the session to receive an access token for further authentication.
