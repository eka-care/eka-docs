Patients can scan a **Health Facility QR code** available at the facility registration counter.

The User/Patient can share their **ABHA Profile** with the HMIS/LIMS software used by the Health Facility by scanning
a facility specific QR Code. This enables the patients to instantly register themselves, share their ABHA address
and optionally obtain a token number from the facility.

### Get Scan & Share Token
The user can scan a QR code from a hospital or clinic to generate a Scan & Share token, using the extracted IDs
and device location. The response includes HIP details, token expiry, and an option to display the token.
