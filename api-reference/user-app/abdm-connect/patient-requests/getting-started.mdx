#### 1. Consents
These are consents requests by another HIUs(Doctors / PHR Apps / EMRs)
to view the patient care context/documents.

#### 2. Subscription Requests
These are the requests created by PHR Apps to get notification when new
care context is created for the patient by other HIPs.

#### 3. Authorization Requests
These are raised by HIPs to link a document to the Patients ABHA Address.

<Note> User Authorization will be required for all these operations.</Note>
