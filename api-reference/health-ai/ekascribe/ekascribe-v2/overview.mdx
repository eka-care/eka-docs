The EkaScribe API provides a set of endpoints for working with voice data. This API is designed to be easy to use and integrate into your applications, allowing you to leverage the power of voice recognition and transcription technologies to get desired formatted results.

Each flow from audio upload to get results is linked with particular business-id and transaction-id. This allows you to track the status of associated transcriptions.

## Process Overview

**1. Presigned URL**: Get a presigned URL for uploading audio files to an S3 bucket. This step needs to provide txn-id and action.

**2. File upload on Presigned URL**: Use the presigned URL to upload your audio files. This step needs to provide the audio file, action and the response received in the previous step.

**3. Start Transcription**: Start the transcription process for the uploaded audio files.

**4. Transcription Result**: Get the results of the transcription process once it is complete.
