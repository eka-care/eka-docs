### 2. Upload Audio Files
```python
import requests
import os
from io import BytesIO
import json

def upload_file(upload_data, folder_path, file_path):
    """Upload a single audio file"""
    file_name = os.path.basename(file_path)
    upload_data['fields']['key'] = folder_path + file_name
    
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        files = {'file': (file_name, file)}
        response = requests.post(upload_data['url'], data=upload_data['fields'], files=files)
    
    if response.status_code == 204:
        return {'key': folder_path + file_name, 'size': os.path.getsize(file_path)}
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Upload failed: {response.status_code}")
```

## Complete Upload Workflow

```python
# Collect all audio files in a list
audio_files = [
    "/path/to/consultation_audio.wav",
    "/path/to/follow_up_audio.wav"
]

# Same as the one used in presigned url
transaction_id = "unique_transaction_id_123"


action = "ekascribe-v2"

# Step 1: Get presigned URL
upload_response = get_presigned_url(txn_id=transaction_id, action=action)

# Step 2: Upload audio files
upload_results = []
for audio_file in audio_files:
    result = upload_file(
        upload_response['uploadData'].copy(),  # Use copy to avoid modifying original
        upload_response['folderPath'],
        audio_file
    )
    upload_results.append(result)
    print(f"Uploaded: {result['key']}")


# Process responses
for response in upload_results:
    # Handle response data as needed
    print(f"File: {response['key']}, Size: {response['size']} bytes")
```

## HTTP Status Codes

| 204 | File uploaded successfully |
| 403 | Upload failed (expired policy) |

## Key Notes

- **Same Presigned URL**: Both audio files and JSON use the same presigned URL from the API
- **JSON Filename**: Auto-generated as `{txn_id}.json` in the same folder as audio files
- **Upload Location**: All files (audio + JSON) go to the same S3 folder path
- **File Paths**: Only filenames are stored in JSON, not full paths
- **Metadata**: Request body data becomes S3 metadata with `x-amz-meta-` prefix
