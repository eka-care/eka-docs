You can take assessments using eka client

### 0. Prerequisites
- Install the eka client using pip:
```bash
pip install eka-client
```
- Import the client:
```python
from eka_client import EkaClient
```
- Initialize the client:
```python
client = EkaClient(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
)
```

#### 1. To start an assessment:
```python
first_question_form = client.assessment.start(
    age=20, 
    gender="M", 
    workflow_id=4002,
    practitioner_uuid="example_pract_uuid_123",
    patient_uuid="example_patient_uuid_123",
    unique_identifier="example_unique_id_123",
    context=additional_context
)
```

You can set additional context as a stringified json.
```python
import json
additional_context = json.loads(
    {
        "name": "Rakesh",
        "city": "Pune"
    }
)
```
