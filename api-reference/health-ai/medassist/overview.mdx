## How it Works

MedAssist operates through a session-based approach:

1. **Session Creation**: Use your API key to create a new session
2. **WebSocket Connection**: Connect to the session via WebSocket for real-time communication
3. **Multi-format Communication**: Send text messages, audio, or files through the WebSocket connection

## Supported Content Types

- **Text Messages**: Direct text-based medical queries
- **Audio Messages**: Voice recordings for medical consultations
- **File Uploads**: Medical documents, images, or reports

## Authentication

All API requests require an `x-agent-id` header containing your API key. WebSocket connections use session tokens for authentication.

## Getting Started

1. Create a session using the [Create Session API](/api-reference/health-ai/medassist/create-session)
2. Connect to the WebSocket endpoint using the session ID
3. Authenticate with the session token
4. Start sending messages in your preferred format
