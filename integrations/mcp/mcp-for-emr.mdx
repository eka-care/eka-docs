  - Direct async Python library
  - Sync wrapper (CrewAI-compatible)
- **Modular architecture**
  - Easily extend with new Eka.care API modules
- **Authentication**
  - Client ID / Client Secret with JWT token management for local connections  
  - OIDC flow for remote server deployments  
  - Optional API key support
- **LLM-optimized**
  - Structured, predictable responses designed for AI consumption
- **Error transparency**
  - Eka.care API errors are forwarded directly for easier debugging

---

## Limits

- **Python version**
  - Requires **Python ≥ 3.10**

## Dependencies

Core dependencies required to run the MCP server:

```bash
FastMCP          # MCP protocol implementation (git main branch)
httpx            # Async HTTP client for API calls
pydantic         # Data validation and settings management
PyJWT            # Authentication token handling
py-key-value-aio # Redis-based async storage for auth tokens
python-dotenv    # Environment configuration
```
