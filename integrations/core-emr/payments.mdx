## Payments & Transactions

A **Payment** (or **Transaction**) represents a financial record created when a patient pays for a healthcare service. Payment records capture essential financial details required for billing, reconciliation, and reporting within the **Core EMR**.

Each payment includes information such as the **amount**, **payment method**, **receipt ID**, and the **current payment status**.

## Notes & Considerations

- **Status-driven lifecycle**  
  Payments typically move through states such as initiated, completed, failed, or refunded.

- **Service linkage**  
  Payments should be associated with visits, appointments, procedures, or invoices for accurate financial mapping.

- **Auditability**  
  All updates to payment records should be traceable to support audits and compliance.

- **Gateway-agnostic**  
  Core EMR records payment outcomes while actual processing may be handled by external payment gateways.

- **Operational validation**  
  Clinics should verify completed payments before closing encounters or issuing final documents.
