## Notes & Considerations

- **Single source of truth**  
  Patient profiles should be the authoritative reference for all clinical and operational workflows.

- **Data accuracy**  
  Ensure demographic and contact information is kept up to date to avoid downstream errors.

- **Privacy and consent**  
  Patient data must be handled in compliance with applicable data protection and healthcare regulations.

- **Identity management**  
  Deduplication and verification processes are important to prevent multiple records for the same individual.

- **Extensible records**  
  Patient profiles can be enriched over time with additional clinical, administrative, and contextual data.
