## Clinic

A **Clinic** is a healthcare facility where doctors provide medical services. Clinic profiles represent physical or virtual care locations and act as the operational anchor for appointments, doctors, and patient interactions.

Each clinic record includes details such as **name**, **address**, **contact information**, **specialties**, and **operating hours**.
