## Notes & Considerations

- **Informational only**  
  MedAssist provides medical information and guidance but does not replace professional medical advice.

- **Session-scoped context**  
  Conversation context is maintained within a session and should be persisted externally if needed.

- **Verification recommended**  
  Outputs should be reviewed by healthcare professionals before being used in clinical decision-making.

- **Privacy and compliance**  
  Ensure proper handling of patient data and compliance with applicable healthcare regulations.

- **Network requirements**  
  Real-time communication requires stable WebSocket connectivity.
