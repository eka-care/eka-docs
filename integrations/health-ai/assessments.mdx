## Assessment Platform APIs

The **Assessment Platform APIs** enable structured, standardized capture of **patient-reported health data** to support patient-facing, clinical, and enterprise workflows.

Using configurable assessment flows and questionnaires, teams can integrate assessments at multiple touchpoints across the care journey while ensuring consistent data models for downstream systems, analytics, and decision support.

## Patient-Facing Use Cases

### Symptom Assessment
Guide patients through adaptive questionnaires to capture symptoms in a structured format for triage, clinician review, and decision support workflows.

### General Health Assessment
Collect baseline health, lifestyle, and habit data in a consistent schema to support longitudinal tracking and personalized experiences.

### Patient Onboarding
Embed structured health intake and medical history assessments into onboarding or signup flows, ensuring consistent data capture across systems.

### Pre-Consultation Data Collection
Capture structured patient information before a visit to help clinicians prepare in advance and reduce consultation time.

### Follow-Up and Post-Care Assessments
Trigger assessments after consultations, procedures, or discharge to collect recovery status, side effects, and outcome data.

### Preventive Care and Wellness Programs
Run periodic assessments to collect lifestyle and wellness data that can power reminders, nudges, and long-term health programs.

## Clinical Use Cases

### Health Risk Screening
Run standardized screening assessments to identify potential health risks and generate structured risk indicators for alerts, flags, or preventive care workflows.

### Teleconsultation Support
Integrate assessments into teleconsultation flows to ensure clinicians receive complete, structured patient inputs before or during virtual visits.

### Chronic Condition Monitoring
Run recurring assessments for chronic conditions to track symptom progression, adherence, and patient-reported outcomes over time.

### Clinical Research and Data Collection
Standardize patient-reported data collection for studies and pilots, enabling clean datasets for clinical analysis and reporting.

## Enterprise Use Cases

### Backend Integration APIs and SDKs
Integrate assessments directly into EMRs and enterprise systems with full control over assessment logic, UI, and data handling across the complete lifecycle.

### Quick Web Integration (Web SDK)
Launch assessments using ready-to-use UI components to reduce development effort while delivering structured responses to backend systems via APIs.

### Population Health and Analytics
Aggregate structured assessment responses across cohorts to support population-level insights, risk stratification, and reporting dashboards.
