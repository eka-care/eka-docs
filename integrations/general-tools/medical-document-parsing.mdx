## Medical Document Parsing

The **Medical Document Parsing API** allows you to upload lab report documents (PDF or image formats) and extract **structured clinical data** from unstructured files. It converts scanned or digital lab reports into machine-readable formats suitable for downstream clinical and analytical workflows.

## What It Extracts

Parsed results include:

- Lab test names  
- Measured values  
- Units of measurement  
- Normal reference ranges  
- Associated clinical metadata  

The output is available in:
- **FHIR format**
- **Enhanced JSON format**

---

## Use Cases

- Digitizing scanned lab reports  
- Enriching patient health records  
- Enabling search and analytics on lab data  
- Powering clinical workflows and decision support systems  

---

## How It Works

1. **Upload Report**  
   Upload a scanned lab report (PDF or image).  
   You receive a `document_id` for the uploaded file.

2. **Retrieve Parsed Report**  
   Use the `document_id` to fetch structured results in:
   - FHIR format, or
   - Enhanced JSON format

3. **Delete Report**  
   Remove the uploaded document using its `document_id`.

## Key Characteristics

- Supports both PDF and image-based lab reports  
- Produces structured, machine-readable clinical data  
- Designed for integration into clinical systems and AI workflows  
- Informational extraction only; no clinical interpretation

---

## Scope & Limitations

- Focused on laboratory report parsing  
- Accuracy depends on document quality and scan clarity  
- Parsed data should be clinically verified before use
